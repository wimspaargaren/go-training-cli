# The TODO CLI tool

In this exercise we're going to implement a CLI tool which will store a todo list for us.

## Functionalities

The base functionality of the app should contain the following:

* List my todos
* Update a todo item
* Create a todo item
* Delete/Complete a todo item

### Storage

* The makefile includes a command for spinning up a postgres instance, in order to store the todos.
